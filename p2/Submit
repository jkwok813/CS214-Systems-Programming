This project was extremely difficult, as we were running short on time between learning the material and writing the code.
When beginning, we wrote the add and insert methods separately to tokenize the WFD. However, we had a lot of trouble
getting it so that it would calculate between each different file. That's why there's an unused int file inside
of struct List. After a while, we figured it out and we got into refining our threads.
Our threads also gave us a pretty big issue, we focused mostly on getting the threads to work
with the defaults before looking at optional arguments. It worked up to a point, and then
there was a major issue in which one of the analysis pthread_creates used filethread[x] instead
of analysis somehow. We're not sure how such a silly mistake slipped into it, but it was resolved
and it worked. However, we struggled greatly with directories and recursively adding files into it.
Suffix optional argument was the hardest excluding directories, and we struggled to
implement it into working. Bugs include directories not working.
