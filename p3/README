When we began writing, we referenced the sample code in creating and connecting the socket. 

To test our code, we utilized nc and ./s to send test cases between a server and our client. 
We wrote out tests on paper, and checked to see if it returned the right stuff from our
alphabetically sorted linked list. When writing the code, we started by making sure
that everything worked in order before writing out our error codes and print success statements
through a large amount of printf statements to see what was being written and read from
the linked list. We used a variety of tests such as the example listed on the p3r1.pdf
document and our own test cases where we wrote random words with random keys and values and 
tested those. 

Overall, the biggest bug we ran into was a memleak that took a while to diagnose and 
fix up. Through a mess of printf statements and markers, we eventually patched it up.
