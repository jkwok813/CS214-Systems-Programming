This project was made by Justin Kwok and Robert Jones. NetIDs: jdk179 and rlj80.

To begin, we first took in file input and made it read each line. At first, we tried scanning in word by word but after we ran into
some complications, we decided to read it line by line. The method we used didn't change much, we scanned in the strings and checked
if it would overflow the width. We wrote the code over a couple times to fix various bugs. To test if the codes worked, we just had 
random text files that we would print. At some point during the testing, our program would print extra characters that it wasn't supposed to,
so we made it print character by character instead. 

For part 2, we copied over a lot of the code for part 1. Because we didn't have prior experience using it, we played around a lot
with printf statements to see if they would work. After learning how to use the macros, we applied it to our program.
